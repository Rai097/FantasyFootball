# Tasks

## Resume here
- Release 1 (advice fixes) shipped 2026-10-26: injury-discounted My Team lineup; waivers claim future starters,
  new Stash call, no priority on injured/DNP players (DESIGN.md "Waivers v2").
- Next: release 2 = import fixes (see Backlog). Then the hosting decision (persistent league data; maybe ff.raibot.us).
- Open bugs: none known beyond the backlog.

## Waiting on
- Yahoo Fantasy API approval for the app's Client ID (applied; still pending as of 2026-10-26).
  Until then use the browser import (docs/IMPORT.md). No code change needed once approved.

## To confirm
- Local test run: `npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test` not yet run on this machine.

## Backlog
Release 2 — import fixes (verified against the owner's raw browser import, 2026-10-26):
- Standings/records are not captured by the bookmarklet: every team shows "–" (power-rank ties, record display).
- Waiver priority is not captured ("Waiver priority unknown").
- Team names arrive with the league-name prefix ("<League> - <Team>") from the bookmarklet itself.
- The free-agent list has no K or DEF, so kicker/defense streaming advice cannot work for imports.
- Footer said "regular season ends week 18" before a league loaded; check it reads 14 with the league.

Known limitations (not scheduled):
- Future-starter claims ignore position depth (e.g. a TE claim when three TEs are rostered = a trade chip, not a lineup fix).
- Trade lineups do not apply the Q/D/O discount (only My Team / power ranks do).
- Waivers now loads the depth chart (~55 MB, cached 12 h; wiped on Render restarts), so the first Waivers load after a
  wake is slower.

Hosting (decision needed from the owner):
- Imports vanish on every Render restart; only the importing browser can restore them. Options: Render paid disk
  (~$7/mo), a free external DB, or move to the owner's raibot.us host (ff.raibot.us) if it has persistent storage.
